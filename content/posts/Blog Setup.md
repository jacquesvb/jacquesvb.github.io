- Create a new Hugo site and CD into that directory.
- Type ``git init`` to initialize a Git repo.
-  Go to https://themes.gohugo.io/ and install a theme by following instructions for selected theme.
- In Obsidian, create a "posts" folder to store your blog posts and an "attachments" folder to store images and other media.
